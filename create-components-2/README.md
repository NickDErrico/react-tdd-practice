# Create Components 2

## Overview
Your goal here is to make the tests pass. You can run them by running `npm test` inside the terminal in the directory of the project you would like to test. You will notice that your `App` component file is empty. Fill it in with the necessary code to make the tests pass. If you need more guidance, try looking at the `app.test.js` file to see what it expects.

## User stories:
 * As a user:
  - When I arrive at the homepage, I see a heading (h1) text of "Todo List"
  - Below the heading, I see a bulleted list of 3 todos (hardcoded into the component).

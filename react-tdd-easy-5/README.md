# React Component Practice

In this exercise, you will practice building a small todo list with 2 components:

- App
- TodosList

## Guidelines

- In the App component, the todos property on the state object must be called `todos`
- There must be 3 todos displayed on the page that were passed down to the TodosList component using props
